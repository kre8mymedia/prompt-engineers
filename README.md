## 📌 Projects

We will add a list of the main projects hosted within this mono repo and a brief description of each. This is not an exhaustive list, so we invite you to explore the different directories for more projects and additional information.

- `chat-ui`: This project is a Chat GPT clone starter UI with streaming support. It aims to provide an interactive interface that allows users to effectively utilize and interact with GPT-based AI.
- `proxy-api`: This project provides an API for protecting API keys for public unauthenticated usage. It acts as a security layer, ensuring that API keys are not exposed while being used in a public setting.
- `full-stack-with-sse`: This project includes a very minimal React Typescript UI for testing response from a FastAPI that includes SSE support. NOTE: The intention was to add streaming support with SSE but experiencing issues with full streaming. Will respond well as simple chat interface.
